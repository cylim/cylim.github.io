                I am a full stack software engineer who recently decided to quit full-time onsite jobs and start freelancing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Primarily working with JavaScript, especially React and Node.js. I am also capable of building the basic Continuous
                Integration and Deployment pipelines and increasing the site reliability.

                As a person, we should always live in a challenging zone which is optimal for learning. Comfort zone is boring, and too
                much of challenging will brings anxiety and frustration which might eventually blow out a person. It seems like this
                role will be the one which fixes into the challenging zone.

                <li>
                    Due to my current time zone is GMT +8, which is about 12 hours ahead of most Canada region. It
                    might be hard to stay in sync for weekly meetings, learning sessions and casual video hangouts. May I know how LemonStand
                    handle this situation?
